This dashboard empowers mission driven organizations to harness the power of data visualization for social change. The data set talks about the literacy rates in Tamilnadu. It is distributed according to the cities and their ranks. It contains the population, as per the gender.
This dashboard gives us the insight about the female population when compared to the total, and it addresses the question of where the state is on literacy wise.
